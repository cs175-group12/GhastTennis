103 fixed the clamping on pitch
104 had both punishment for staring at the ground and reward for aiming at ghast
105 has revised ghast spawning, and only punishment for staring at the ground.the agent still stares into space
106 i used better random seeding apparently and both rewards and punishments for where it looks.
107 still fixing random, gonna use random state maybe. biases mutate too. no longer stares at ceiling
108 pentupled reward and punishments based on lookdir
109 not multithreaded, plateau early on and stay stagnant. doesnt translate between runs still...
110 purely deterministic, hand designed ghast spawns. accidentally 109 , peaked and plateued at 155
	at least the gains translate kinda...
111 bigger, deeper neural nets. from 3 to 7 layers to 5 to 10, and from sizes 9 to 81 to 91 to 729
	considering some sort of computational graph network instead of neural nets.
112 complete random. nothing better than 105
113 complete random. random initialization now between -.5/sqrt(inputsize) and positive that. bad results
114 fixed biasse to average to 0 , return to evolution, fixed axons to scale to 1/sqrt(input)
115 i forgot
116 reduced layers and complexity - overfitting identified
117 more training, 410 peak, some errors
118 extended evaluation time, suspected max score hit after 100 gen no improvement on 117
119 the errors were due to hitting all the ghasts. fixed, training much better now

network version 4
1-2 testing load/save
3 ghast fireball starts at +1.5 y
4 ghast will not shoot if player is within 4 units
5 more generations, ghasts spawn further away and further apart
